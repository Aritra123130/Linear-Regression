This project focuses on assisting a real estate agent in predicting housing prices across various regions in the United States through a Linear Regression model. The dataset provided, USA_Housing.csv, comprises valuable features such as the average income of city residents, average age of houses, the number of rooms and bedrooms, and the city’s population—all contributing factors to housing prices. The process begins with an in-depth exploration of the data using Pandas for loading and cleaning, ensuring there are no missing or erroneous values. Visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib are employed to understand the distribution of features and their correlation with the target variable, which is the house price. By analyzing these relationships, we can select the most impactful features for the model while excluding non-relevant data like the 'Address' column.

Next, the data is split into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn’s train_test_split() function to facilitate model training and performance evaluation. The Linear Regression model is then built and trained using Scikit-learn’s LinearRegression() class, followed by an assessment through metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. These evaluations provide insights into how well the model captures the nuances of the data.

To verify the assumptions of linear regression, we visualize the residuals to ensure a near-normal distribution and plot actual versus predicted prices to check the model’s accuracy. These steps help confirm that the model is not underfitting or overfitting. Finally, we create a user-friendly interface where the agent can input specific house features and receive an estimated price, making the model practical for real estate pricing decisions. This approach not only leverages the power of Python’s data manipulation and machine learning libraries but also offers a comprehensive, data-driven solution to real-world problems faced by real estate professionals.
